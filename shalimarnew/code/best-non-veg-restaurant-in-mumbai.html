            <p>You have not had biryani until you’ve had Best Biryani Restaurant in Mumbai And Shalimar Restaurant gives you just that, authentic shalimar dum biryani flavours available in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian variants. Come get a taste of asli Shalimar Biryani, you won’t be able to go back to regular biryani after this. We recommend the vegetable biryani, shalimar dum biryani, boneless chicken biryani. Don’t forget to pair them all with delicious and trademark Mirch Ka Saalan.</p>
            <p>
                Be it a house party, a family get together or even a quick lunch with colleagues, Biryani Is India’s Favourite Dish! Not only is it delicious but it also isn’t very heavy on the pocket. It’s one of the few dishes that one can have by itself. No accompaniments required! One might not associate Mumbai as where one can get the best biryani places. Mumbai does have Delhi, Lucknow and even Hyderabad as stiff competition. 
            </p>
            <p> The dessert came to Medieval India
            with
            the many Central Asian merchants and dynasties that settled in the
            Indian
            subcontinent in the 16th to 18th century.The present form of falooda
            was
            developed in the Mughal Empire and spread with its conquests.</p>
            <p> 
                However, there are a few places in the bay who do manage to serve a pretty mean version of what is (arguably) one of the most popular rice dishes in the world.

                                                    Be it a house party, a family get together or even a quick lunch with colleagues, Biryani Is India’s Favourite Dish! Not only is it delicious but it also isn’t very heavy on the pocket. It’s one of the few dishes that one can have by itself. No accompaniments required! One might not associate Mumbai as where one can get the best biryani places. Mumbai does have Delhi, Lucknow and even Hyderabad as stiff competition.

                                                developed in the Mughal Empire and spread with its conquests.</p>

                                                    However, there are a few places in the bay who do manage to serve a pretty mean version of what is (arguably) one of the most popular rice dishes in the world.
